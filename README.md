# MazeGameOpenGL

## Brief
MazeGame is a simple Cmake project written in C++ using OpenGL to render 3D graphics. Actually it's my second approach to that game, this time I would like to solve problems I have met at first attempt. Main problem was "segmentation fault" problem while trying to create huge maze map. Another problem was flexibility of the code that needed some improvement.

## ToDo list:
- graphics:
  - maze figure - done
  - pawn figure
  - taken path figure
- maze:
  - generators
  - solvers
- game
- Cmake (solve problems with including vcpkg submodule)
- documentation in Doxygen

The game is about solving maze puzzle displayed on screen, to achieve that, use keyboard arrows to move cube pawn around.
