## MazeGameOpenGL
MazeGame is a simple Cmake project written in C++ using OpenGL to render 3D graphics. Actually it's my second approach to that game, this time I would like to solve problems I have met at first attempt.
The game is about solving maze puzzle displayed on screen, to achieve that, use keyboard arrows to move cube pawn around.
